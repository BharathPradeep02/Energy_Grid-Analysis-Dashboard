# Energy_Grid-Analysis-Dashboard
Power BI dashboard analyzing energy grid demand and supply using real-world public dataset.
Project Overview :
 This project presents an interactive Energy Grid Analysis Dashboard built using Power BI and a publicly available electricity dataset.
 The dashboard provides insights into power consumption, demand vs supply, renewable energy usage, and fault distribution to support data-driven decision making.
 Business Problem
Electricity providers must continuously monitor:
 Energy demand vs supply
 Renewable energy contribution
 Fault occurrences in the grid
 Monthly and daily consumption trends
 This dashboard helps stakeholders quickly identify patterns and make informed decisions.
Dashboard Insights :
 Power Consumption Analysis
 Monthly Total Power Consumption trend
 Daily Average Consumption pattern tracking
 Comparison of Predicted vs Current Load
 Renewable Energy Monitoring
 Solar vs Wind energy contribution
 Total renewable energy generated
 Fault Monitoring
 Transformer fault vs Overload condition distribution
 Helps in preventive maintenance planning
 Grid Performance KPIs
 Total Voltage
 Average Power Factor
 Location & Year filters for interactive analysis
