# Energy_Grid-Analysis-Dashboard
Power BI dashboard analyzing energy grid demand and supply using real-world public dataset.
Project Overview :
 This project presents an interactive Energy Grid Analysis Dashboard built using Power BI and a publicly available electricity dataset.
 The dashboard provides insights into power consumption, demand vs supply, renewable energy usage, and fault distribution to support data-driven decision making.
 Business Problem
Electricity providers must continuously monitor:
 Energy demand vs supply
 Renewable energy contribution
 Fault occurrences in the grid
 Monthly and daily consumption trends
 This dashboard helps stakeholders quickly identify patterns and make informed decisions.
